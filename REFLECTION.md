## AI Tools Used

I mainly used Claude to help with my work, with moderate support from ChatGPT when I run out of conversation allowance per day with Claude, and minor support from Google Colab notebook's Gemini. 
Claude was a great help throughout this project. I find that this AI excels at explaining problems and giving tutorials, especially in programing as it has a side-by-side view to see the codes and the explanation.
However, Claude does have issue with rambling, and several issues within it's code. It was not too difficult to overcome these issues, as long as the prompt was thorough and intentional. 
As for ChatGPT, it mainly provides code enhancement and issue detection for my project. I use it as my tester, while Claude acts as my developer. 
Using both tools really helped me in critically think of a prompting strategy or how to further enhance my codes with proper error handling and overall architecture. 

Another thing that these AIs taught me is how to use Github. As a beginner, I find that Github was extremely hard to navigate, especially when there are so many functions named after jargons and how Jupiter Notebook isn't completely compatible with Github's JSON formats.
However, Claude and ChatGPT helped me navigate this platform, and find alternative ways to upload my Jupiter Notework without the "Invalid Notebook error". 

## Prompting Techniques

I have tried using AI debate technique (See [AI Conversation 4](https://github.com/HeyItsBri/ISYS5002-Assignment-2/blob/36ffb532d9182e0f091530cf44230256b76ddc76/Intro%20To%20Programming%20AI%20conversation_4.txt)).
This strategy was very helpful as there might be issues that I would otherwise overseen. 

The most frequently used technique is Reverse Engineering (See [AI Conversation 1](https://github.com/HeyItsBri/ISYS5002-Assignment-2/blob/9581c006abdd2cf9014ed85c6428475cf1787e85/Intro%20To%20Programming%20AI%20conversation_1.txt), [AI Conversation 2](https://github.com/HeyItsBri/ISYS5002-Assignment-2/blob/36ffb532d9182e0f091530cf44230256b76ddc76/Intro%20To%20Programming%20AI%20conversation_2.txt)).
The initial code I used were mainly from the weekly mini projects provided, and I would ask Claude AI to enhance this code, explain new functions, and overall create a more advanced version of what I've been taught.
I also created a Before-After AI conversation to demonstrate this: See [AI Conversation 3](https://github.com/HeyItsBri/ISYS5002-Assignment-2/blob/36ffb532d9182e0f091530cf44230256b76ddc76/Intro%20To%20Programming%20AI%20conversation_3.txt)

At the end of the project, I mainly used Iterative Refinement Sessions (See [AI Conversation 5](https://github.com/HeyItsBri/ISYS5002-Assignment-2/blob/36ffb532d9182e0f091530cf44230256b76ddc76/Intro%20To%20Programming%20AI%20conversation_5.txt)) to test and improve my codes.

## What Worked Well?

When I first started the project, I felt extreme anxiety as the assignment felt like a big task that I might not be able to complete. However, as I progress, I refer back to the weekly materials and seek further assistance from AIs, which slowly reliefed me from the anxiety.
The instructions given by Dr. Michael was also very clear and thoughtful, which helped as a guide for me to follow and complete my work. 

Surprisingly, the biggest hurdle I had wasn't with the project itself, but to transfer my work from Jupyter Notebook to Github. It took me over 2 hours to truly learn how to use Github, to test out functions that converts Jupyter Notebooks to Github ipynb file and even metadata editing methods. 
The moment that I could upload my notebook to github under the correct format, while still able to link an embedded badge to open Google Colab, I felt incredible proud of myself despite it being a simple task for many people. 
To me, this achievement has shown patience, willingness to test and fail, and ability to learn, and it is my proudest moment. 

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I'd probably want to create a pygame file for this weather application and integrate everything into it, instead of the current function-in-cell format.
It was a fun assignment nevertheless, and I can see myself working on this project as a hobby instead of a required assignment. 

## Final Thoughts
When I first briefly learnt programming in my bachelor, which was 4 years ago, I had to search every error and functions manually through WW3 and Stackoverflow. Now that there are AI assistants, my learning journey has became more comfortable and I could learn much more than I used to before.
Rather than getting the answers directly, I learnt to read and analyse codes strategically and critically chose and adopt codes from different AIs. I'm grateful to have more accessibilities and materials as a beginner in the programming industry, and this assignment definitely gave me more confidence and experience to take on future projects.
